# Thanks to:
[@98o718](https://www.github.com/98o718) for mentoring me when I just started and some useful advices for the engine.
[3Angle](https://www.youtube.com/@3Angle_) without whose tutorials the WebGPU rendering implementation would take significantly more time.
[Jeronim Calavera](https://t.me/hyperduh) without whose charming mind I would never have fallen in such a deep love with video games to develop an engine.
